# fixbook
Little script for fixing Facebook if you just want to use the chat.

Removes all html elements except chat windows and the blue bar on top, and extends chat windows.

Now with dark theme (wow!).

# How to use?
* Open fixbook.js or fixbook_origcolors.js and copy all text
* Add a new bookmark in your browser (on bookmark bar)
* Paste the text in the URL field and give the bookmark a name
* Click the bookmark every time you open FB and all ads and stuff are loaded

# Why?
I often get frustrated when I use Facebook chat because of the amount of useless things on the screen. The right nav is especially annoying on laptops, or when multitasking, because it just takes up space that could be used by chat windows. So I made a lil script that gets rid of all that, and also expands chat windows a bit.

Yes, I know there are alternatives, but most people I know insist on sticking to the awful FB Messenger.
