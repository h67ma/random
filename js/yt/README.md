## scripts
* ytDisablePolymer.js - restore old Youtube UI for current page
* ytGetThumb.js - get best quality thumbnail generated by Youtube
* ytPlaylistSnapshot.js - save a list of videos from playlist page
  * List includes links, titles, channel names, lengths, and (optionally) thumbnails - NOT videos
  * Helps when you want to find that one video that got deleted from Youtube and you only see *\[deleted video\]* in your playlist
  * Works only with old Youtube UI (disable_polymer=true)
  * By default thumbnails are not downloaded - images are displayed from Youtube server, so they *will* go down when the video is removed
  * To save thumbnails to hard drive, open the list generated by the script in internet browser and press ctrl+S. That will save a version of the page with links to local images (images will also be download)
* ytPlaylistSnapshotCsv.js - save the same list to csv
* ytRmPlayerOverlay.js - remove video player buttons, scrollbar, text, and top/bottom gradient
