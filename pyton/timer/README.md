A simple multi-timer for Windows, possibly other OSes (did not check). Allows creation of multiple timers with custom names and duration in seconds. When a timer expires, a notification is displayed and timer starts counting down again. There is no Smooze/dismiss function; it's supposed to be used as a reminder to take a break from PC.
