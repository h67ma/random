A simple multi-timer. Allows creation of multiple timers with custom names and duration in seconds. When a timer expires, a notification or blank screen is displayed and timer starts counting down again. It's supposed to be used as a reminder to take a break from PC or remind yourself to blink.

Blank screen can be dismissed with a mouse click. The window doesn't steal focus so you can keep typing, just with closed eyes.

For supported OSes please see the [pystray documentation](https://pystray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#selecting-a-backend).

Replace icon with image of your choice. An icon of bloody eyeball is recommended.
