**This is NOT a playlist/video downloader**. The only thing it does is it saves a *list* of videos from a youtube playlist, with links, titles, channel names, lengths, and (optionally) thumbnails.

# Why?
Videos on Youtube get deleted, unlisted, and blocked. That's bad in itself, but the other problem is that if you saved the video in a playlist, it will just display *\[Deleted video\]* or something like this instead of title. No channel name. No thumbnail. Not even video length. You can only guess what was that video. I made a little script that allows to take "snapshots" of playlists and save them on local drive. With that, if a video gets deleted, you can still find or at least search for it on other streaming services, or perhaps also on Youtube (reupload).

Note: this works only with old Youtube UI. Enable it by adding *disable_polymer=true* param to Youtube url, or by installing a browser extension that does that automatically.

# How to use
* First go to https://github.com/szycikm/ytPlaylistSnapshot/blob/master/ytPlaylistSnapshot.js and copy all the code to clipboard
* Create a new bookmark in your internet browser. Name it how you want, and paste the code you copied in the address field
* Open a playlist (NOT a video that's in a playlist, but the playlist itself)
* If the playlist is longer than 100 videos, scroll down and press "see more" until all videos are revealed
* Click on the bookmark you created before
* Parsing the page might take a few seconds, depending on playlist length
* Select location where to save the list (as html file)
* By default thumbnails are not downloaded - images are displayed from Youtube server, so they *will* go down when a video is removed
* If you want to save thumbnails to hard drive, open the list generated by the script in internet browser and press ctrl+S. That will save a version of the page with links to local images (images will also be download)

# Bugs
* Sometimes, when used too quickly after the page loads, the script may fail to match. Maybe some DOM elements are placed asynchronously or something. If the downloaded file is large (e.g. >1MB) the script has failed and whole page was downloaded. Oopsie daisy. Just try again and it will probably work.

# Tools used
* plain js
* regex
